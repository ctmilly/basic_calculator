# basic_calculator
right now this calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of various types of numbers. This includes: inegers, decimals, and fractions. 
the next step to this calculator is adding the ability to graph using the matlib module. essentially I am working on storing x and y respective values in their respective arrays to then graph in the GUI. 

let me note this project was inteded to be a basic calculator. So it is unlikely any advanced computational abilities are less than likely in the near future at least. 

in the grand scheme this will eventually be turned into a basic calculator that will be downloaded as an application on any computer for basic computation use.
