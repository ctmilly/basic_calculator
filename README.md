# basic_calculator

version 1.1.3 includes the ability to graph by entering the # of x and y values the user picks and then entering the corresponding values of which the user decides.

right now this calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of various types of numbers. This includes: inegers, decimals, and fractions. 
the next step to this calculator is adding the ability to graph using the matlib module. essentially I am working on storing x and y respective values in their respective arrays to then graph in the GUI. 

version 1.1.4 will have the ability have the user enter various x and y values and store them in a string, different from previous versions as you had to declare how many entries you wanted. Now you will be able to just enter the values you wish to have. 

let me note this project was inteded to be a basic calculator. So it is unlikely any advanced computational abilities are less than likely in the near future at least. 

in the grand scheme this will eventually be turned into a basic calculator that will be downloaded as an application on any computer for basic computation use.
